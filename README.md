I'll be working with a dataset uploaded to Kaggle that contains datapoints that affects the passenger's survival tendency of the titanic disaster  (with each row consisting of each passenger information)

In this project, I'll:

1.Prepare the data for machine learning

2.Train a model

3.Measure the accuracy of your model

4.Prepare and make a Kaggle submission.

This Model had an accuracy of 78.7% on Kaggle Website
